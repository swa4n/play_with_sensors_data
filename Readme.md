## Project Scope
Based on sensor data produced by Android mobile phones, we want to determine if a person has visited a given location and decide which locations are more likely to be the home location of a person, and which are the more likely to be his/her work location.

## Running the code
First, run the following command on your bash:

>pip install -r requirements.txt

Then check the notebook for usage examples.
